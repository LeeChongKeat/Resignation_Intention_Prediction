Based on the visualization of the data, it is evident that both working years and salary directly impact the level of resignation intention. 
Employees with more work years tend to have lower turnover rates, and higher salaries can further reduce the percentage.

Data analysis indicates that both working experience and belongingness influence an employee's intention to resign. Those with greater tenure tend to exhibit lower turnover rates, and enhanced belongingness can further reduce these rates.
